# pyboat-deploy

## Simple script to deploy PyBoat to a server with Pylon in it.

1. Clone the repo
2. Copy config.js.example -> config.js
3. Edit config.js and input the values
4. `npm test`


Feel free to use this script to deploy other things.


**NOTES**

This will only work if the deployment for the guild you input already exists, __make sure to deploy anything to your server on the Pylon dashboard before using this script__
